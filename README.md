# Naani-Geological-Exploration-bot
An exploration bot designed to navigate a terrain and deliver sensors to particular sites


Me and my peers worked on a geological exploratory bot that would navigate a terrain and drop sensors at particular sites.

I have added the final arduino code (Naani-integrated) and the progress steps we had.
